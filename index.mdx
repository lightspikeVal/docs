3. **Configure Initial Settings**:
   - **Storage Tier**: Choose between Free, Pro, or Enterprise tiers
   - **Team Members**: Add collaborators if needed (skip for personal projects)
   - **Resource Limits**: Set initial quotas for storage and API calls

4. **Create Workspace**:
   - Review your settings
   - Click **"Create Workspace"**
   - Wait for the workspace to be provisioned (usually takes 10-30 seconds)

### Accessing Your Workspace

Once created, you can access your workspace via:

## How to Create a KV Bucket

### What is a KV Bucket?

A Key-Value (KV) bucket is a container for storing small data items as key-value pairs. It's perfect for configuration data, user preferences, session data, or any structured information that needs fast retrieval.

### Creating a KV Bucket

#### Method 1: Using the Dashboard

1. **Navigate to Your Workspace**:
   - Go to `https://purrscale.com/workspace/your-workspace-name`
   - Click on the **"KV"** tab in the dashboard

2. **Create New Bucket**:
   - Click the **"Create New Bucket"** button
   - Fill in the bucket details:
     - **Bucket Name**: Choose a descriptive name (e.g., "user-preferences")
     - **Description**: Optional description of the bucket's purpose
     - **Access Level**: Public or Private (default: Private)

3. **Configure Bucket Settings**:
   - **TTL (Time To Live)**: Set expiration time for entries (optional)
   - **Max Entries**: Limit the number of key-value pairs (optional)
   - **Retention Policy**: Choose how long to keep deleted data

4. **Create Bucket**:
   - Review your configuration
   - Click **"Create Bucket"**
   - Your bucket is now ready to use!

#### Method 2: Using the API

```bash
# Set up your authentication token
export PURRSCALE_TOKEN="your-firebase-auth-token"

# Create a new KV bucket
curl -X POST https://kvpawcloud.onrender.com/pawk2/new/kv \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PURRSCALE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "my-first-bucket",
    "description": "Storing user preferences",
    "access": "private"
  }'
```

### Adding Data to Your KV Bucket

#### Using the Dashboard:

1. **Select Your Bucket**: Click on the bucket you just created
2. **Add New Entry**: Click **"Add Entry"**
3. **Enter Key-Value Pair**:
   - **Key**: Enter a unique identifier (e.g., "theme-setting")
   - **Value**: Enter the data (can be text, JSON, or any string)
4. **Save**: Click **"Save Entry"**

#### Using the API:

```bash
# Add a key-value entry
curl -X POST https://kvpawcloud.onrender.com/pawk2/kv/my-first-bucket \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PURRSCALE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "key": "theme-setting",
    "value": "dark-mode",
    "metadata": {
      "created_by": "user-123",
      "type": "preference"
    }
  }'
```

### Retrieving Data from Your KV Bucket

#### Using the Dashboard:

1. **Select Your Bucket**: Click on your bucket
2. **View Entries**: All key-value pairs are displayed in a table
3. **Search**: Use the search bar to find specific entries
4. **Edit/Delete**: Use the action buttons to modify entries

#### Using the API:

```bash
# Get a specific key-value entry
curl -X GET https://kvpawcloud.onrender.com/pawk2/storagekv \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PURRSCALE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bucket": "my-first-bucket",
    "key": "theme-setting"
  }'

# List all entries in a bucket
curl -X GET https://kvpawcloud.onrender.com/pawk2/listkv \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PURRSCALE_TOKEN"
```
